    "body": "@jlaneve Had to make a quick change to get `listIssues` to work with pulling in the orgs instead of user. When the `allOrg` parameter was set, the requests would then be made as `{user}\\{repo_name}` instead of `{org}\\{repo_name}`. \r\n\r\nTake a look and refactor to have the `listIssues` accept a single repo as normal if `allOrg` is not present and update the other methods to work the same.\r\n\r\n`allUser` also shouldn't assume that all the repos the user has access to is going to directly be listed under the user itself."
